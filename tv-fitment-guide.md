## Fitment Tips

### For Successful Transport:
1. **Measure twice**: Always verify your specific vehicle's cargo door dimensions
2. **Keep the box**: Transport TVs in original packaging for protection
3. **Bring help**: Large TVs require 2+ people for safe handling
4. **Consider orientation**: Some TVs fit flat but not upright
5. **Account for obstacles**: Wheel wells and seat backs can reduce usable space

### Pro Tips:
- **Fold seats down**: Maximizes cargo space depth
- **Remove headrests**: Can provide extra clearance height
- **Angle loading**: Sometimes diagonal insertion works when straight loading doesn't
- **Protect the screen**: Use blankets if removing from box

## When to Consider Delivery:
- TVs 65" and larger
- If your vehicle is smaller than midsize SUV
- If you don't have adequate help for lifting
- Best Buy often offers free delivery for TVs 55" and up

## Emergency Alternatives:
- **Rental truck**: U-Haul, Home Depot truck rental
- **Friend's larger vehicle**: Minivan, large SUV, or pickup
- **Professional delivery**: Often worth the cost for large TVs
- **Take out of box**: Remove TV from packaging (keep all materials for returns)
