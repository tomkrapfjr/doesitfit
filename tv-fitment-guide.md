## Fitment Tips

### For Successful Transport:
1. **Measure twice**: Always verify your specific vehicle's cargo door dimensions
2. **Keep the box**: Transport TVs in original packaging for protection
3. **Bring help**: Large TVs require 2+ people for safe handling
4. **Consider orientation**: Some TVs fit flat but not upright
5. **Account for obstacles**: Wheel wells and seat backs can reduce usable space

### Pro Tips:
- **Fold seats down**: Maximizes cargo space depth
- **Remove headrests**: Can provide extra clearance height
- **Angle loading**: Sometimes diagonal insertion works when straight loading doesn't

## When to Consider Delivery:
- Best Buy offers free delivery on TVs, although same-day delivery may not be available.

## Important Transport Information:
- If you choose to transport a TV yourself and remove it from its box, you forfeit the right to return the TV if it is damaged during transport.
- Improper transport, such as placing a TV on the roof of a vehicle or transporting it without the original packaging, significantly increases the risk of damage. Damaged TVs resulting from improper transport are not eligible for return.
- Consider taking advantage of Best Buy's free delivery service, especially for larger TVs or if you have concerns about safely transporting the TV in your vehicle.
- If you do transport the TV yourself, ensure it is secured properly within the vehicle and is transported upright if possible, following manufacturer recommendations.

## Emergency Alternatives:
- **Rental truck**: U-Haul, Home Depot truck rental
- **Friend's larger vehicle**: Minivan, large SUV, or pickup
- **Professional delivery**: Often worth the cost for large TVs
- **Take out of box**: Remove TV from packaging (keep all materials for returns)
- **Rideshare with larger vehicle option**: UberX or similar
